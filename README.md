This is a NeoPixel clock that uses a ring of 60 pixels, and a DS3231 RTC module with the Adafruit Trinket Pro.

The clock automatically adjusts for daylight savings time and can have the date and time updated from the serial console.

In the future, I plan to have the LED brightness auto-adjust based on the ambient lighting.
